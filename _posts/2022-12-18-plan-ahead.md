I am in a period where I have more motivation to sit in front of my laptop at home, than I have had in a very long time. Maybe it has something to do with days getting shorter and shorter here in cold Denmark? Nevertheless the motivation is there. 

Some of the motivation is towards writing more. As I do here.

Some of the motivation is towards coding. Which I have only sparsely done the last couple of years. 

But the motivation is there. And I cannot procrastinate every time by writing a meta-blog post about it as I am in the middle of here.

What I need to do is spend some time planning ahead. Have some bite-sized tasks broken down that I can work on. I have a few small projects I code, but I haven't really broken down any of the work into smaller sized tasks, so every time I want to work on it I have to overcome a period of trying to figure out what I want to work on.

That little obstacle can be enough for me to open the browser and look for something else instead of working on any of my pet projects.

It reminds me of the book "The case for working with your hands" by Matthew Crawford. In the book there is this concept of "jigging" which I really want to elaborate some more on at a later date. But the gist of it is that you set up boundaries for your work, which lowers the amount of thinking you have to do and instead you can get more done, faster. You already made the decisions - now you have to just put in the work.

When I start thinking about planning ahead on a small project I have, I run into all sorts of "over-thinking" issues. What should I use to break down the tasks? Where should I store the tasks and in what format? Is a small text-file where I just delete the tasks as I go a good option - or would that not give a well-enough representation of what I had achieved - when all the "done" tasks were deleted?

I should just limit myself to what I know has worked in the past. To the best of my knowledge Trello still works as a free option. I have used that in the past - I can use that in the future. 

Break down the work in smaller tasks that I can just take and work on for a couple of hours. I do not need to finish them - if I do not, then I know what to start working on the next time I sit down.

The important part is having tasks that I can easily start on. That I have planned ahead and avoid the obstacle of figuring out what to do, when I find myself with a bit of motivation to do work.

Otherwise I end up writing endless blog posts like this one, devoid of content, but acting like a crutch for my ego, enabling me to say that I did "something".
