When you want to prove yourself, you want to talk. You want to demonstrate your worth. Signal knowledge. Convince people that you are smart.

As a consultant this urge can be extra prevalent. Once you join a new team or project the game is on.

Of course you have to "prove yourself" to your new employer. But the best way to do that, is not to talk and try and convince people that you are clever.

The intelligent way to go about it is actually to ask questions and listen.

A lot of problems and assignments that external consultants are brought on to solve, exists because people either does not have the time or capacity to ask questions and listen for the answers.

All companies have intelligent employees that can solve almost all issues. The role of an external consultant is finding these employees, asking the right questions and then really listening to the answers.

The difficult skill is sorting through the answers and picking the right solutions.

Rarely does the solution exist entirely outside the combined intelligence of the existing company.
