It is 2021 and the new 14 inch MacBook Pro just got announced. I still use an old 2014 MBP which has one of the most amazing keyboards ever fitted to a laptop. But what it also had was the issues with the screen known as "staingate".

"Staingate" essentially is the anti-reflective coating on the MacBook Pro retinas, that would over time start to degrade and turn into a blurry mess on the screen.

The MacBook Pro I have actually had it already when I bought it used. I researched solutions when I got it, but never found anything that would not require a change of the screen itself. That was too big of a step for me as essentially I only used it for writing and putting apps on the AppStore.

But then recently I found a suggestion somewhere online that talked about Listerine. Yes the mouthwash. It sounded too good to be true, but after seeing videos of people using it I had to concede and accept that for whatever reason it seemed to work.

My first thought however was if that stuff can remove anti-glare coating from a screen. Then how healthy is it exactly for your teeth!?

Reading more thoroughly into the issue and solution I found people speculating that it must be the alcohol(ethanol) in Listerine that did the trick. As I had ethanol under the kitchen sink for cleaning I thought that I might as well give it a try.

And low and behold I can confirm that ethanol removes the anti-glare coating quite nicely. I now have a screen that looks better than when I bought the laptop 3-4 years ago.

So if you have the same issue and do not have Listerine in the bathroom, then you may have ethanol in the kitchen.

Happy cleaning.
