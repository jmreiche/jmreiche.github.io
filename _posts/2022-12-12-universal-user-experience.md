I listened to an episode of "Changelog" podcast, while driving down to my parents house, the other day. Probably my first full episode. Apart from the excessive amount of ads, it had a high level of audio production and they allowed the guest to speak her mind.

One of the discussions touched on user interfaces and user experiences of contemporary streaming services, which got a good amount of roasting. They were anything but impressed.

This got me thinking about a thing, that has probably been discussed before, but just not caught my attention. 

Is there such a thing as universal user experience? An experience that everyone agrees is the best or perhaps just; "not bad" to set the bar a little lower?

There is a lot of talk about content. Curation of content for the user. Which topics are the user interested in? Which topics does the user not like?

All of those discussions revolve around the content.

Then there is A/B testing. 

This can in some cases be UX related. But almost exclusively with the goal of finding "the one". Not with the goal of saying user of this type favors X and users of this type favors Y.

It is not that the distinction does not exist. Take Twitter for instance. If you do not like the interface of Twitter, then you can use alternatives as Nitter or other. But you have to look for them from other suppliers. Why can't or won't Twitter supply alternative user experiences?

Some of the buzz surrounding ActivityPub is of course also around the fact that it is just a protocol and there can be 100 different implementations on top of it. 

But everytime there are discussions surrounding user experience, to my ears, they assume that one supplier will build one user experience, which will be the best they can do, then competing suppliers can build *their* best user experience. 

The discussion never mentions the fact that ust as well as you can curate content, you can curate user experiences for your users.
