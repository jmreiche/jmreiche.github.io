It has been some years since I wrote code commercially. I have probably close to 15 years of experience within the .Net sphere and used it almost from its inception. But the last couple of years I have switched to roles which does not involve any coding at all. 

I have been various levels of software architect - which could/should have required my writing code, but did not, then I have been working as business analyst, product owner and most recently as solution architect.

Working freelance has allowed me to make these transitions and take on assignments I found interesting, exploring different roles along the way. 

Some of it has been really fun, some has been frustrating and some has really leveraged my developer background.

One thing I have missed from being a developer is doing "deep work". Really concentrated bouts of work where I can forget about everything around me and just focus on a single task. Especially under some deadline which really focuses the attention. 

The non-developer roles I have taken on has brought a level of management, interaction and persuasion which are very different and also challenging, but rarely lead to pure concentrated deep work. I can make full use of my experience and have lots of interesting discussions and interactions with everything from senior management over sales people to warehouse workers. But rarely are the assignments clearly defined with a set "definition of done".

Most of them are analyzing, giving input or research, where I myself decide when I am confident enough in my conclusions. 

This is in start contrast to working as a developer where there (hopefully) is a clear definition of done and although you may not know entirely how to get there, you know what the end goal is. A lot of the work is done with a singular focus and if you can avoid too many meaningless meetings, then you can actually experience "flow" several times a day.

Today I was reminded how that feels.

The technology chief in the company I currently work for asked me if I could help analyze and visualize some data in an excel sheet, because they needed some data to back up their claims towards a supplier. And if I could do some of it with a deadline of a few hours, then that would be great.

I am by no means an excel wizard. There are people out there that can do real magic with excel. I am not one of them. I can use it to whatever needs I have, which has been pretty basic.

I quickly made some basic pivot tables and diagrams, but it also became apparent that this was not going to cut it as I needed information that was calculated based on the original data. I was sure it could be done with the normal excel tools. But I was not going to be able to do so and in no way with the 2 hour deadline for the first iteration.

What I do know however, is that you can program in VBA on top of excel. So even though it might not be the best or the right way to do it, I was sure that it was a way I could do it.

Hence I quickly brushed up on VBA, constantly looking up syntax, methods, functions etc. to iterate through the existing data I had. This allowed me to extract data in the format that I needed, then paste it into a new worksheet and add pivot tables and diagrams on top of this data to meet the requirements that I had.

I finished the first iteration just in time and later got requests for other views on top of the data. 

All in all I ended up spending the entire day coding VBA. It has been one of the most enjoyable days in a very long time and for a lot of the day I totally lost track of time.

I am sure it is down to the fact that I was in total "flow" and worked away with a clear "definition of done" as well as a short deadline.

I have to find a way to have more work of this kind in the future. It really made me enjoy being at work.
