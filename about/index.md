# About

Hi my name is Jesper and this is my static github page. I already have a website [jesperreiche.com](www.jesperreiche.com) that I use as personal blog, but also highly geared towards my interest in photography.

This page I plan to use a lot more for technical and programming related content.

I currently work as freelance consultant doing everyhting from management consulting over architecture to business analyst. I an not really doing any coding as consultant these days, but I still code quite a lot in my spare time.

My current goal is to somehow break into space-related fields. As I live in Denmark I probably won't be working for NASA or SpaceX and does not have my hopes too high on ending up doing it for a living. But it could also be participating in open source projects and the like.

I will try my best to document my progress so I can see how far I go and have come and also for others to follow along if they like.

You are always free to contact me. I prefer to be contacted by email, the other social media accounts are not checked as regularly.
