# About

Hi my name is Jesper and this is my static github page. I already have a website [jesperreiche.com](https://www.jesperreiche.com) that I use as personal blog, but also highly geared towards my interest in photography.

This page I plan to use a lot more for technical and programming related content.

I currently work as freelance consultant doing everyhting from management consulting over architecture to business analysis. I an not really doing any coding as consultant these days, but I still code some in my spare time.

I have not fully decided on where I want to take this page as opposed to my personal blog. My guess is that I will use this for more tech-related content and use the other for photography and motorcycle-related content. 

There is an itch to release content so I have to scratch it everyonce in a while.

You are always free to contact me. I prefer to be contacted by email, the other social media accounts are not checked as regularly.
