# About

Hi my name is Jesper and this is my static github page. I already have a website [jesperreiche.com](https://www.jesperreiche.com) that I use as personal blog, but also highly geared towards my interest in photography. 

If you are interested in the technology behind this current site then see [what am I looking at](/what-am-i-looking-at).

I currently work as freelance consultant doing everyhting from management consulting over architecture to programing and business analysis. 

I have not fully decided on where I want to take this page as opposed to my personal blog. My original plan was to use it for more technical writing. But ever since I had that thought I have almost had nothing interesting technology-related to say. But I do like the flow of writing posts in Visual Studio code and checking everything in to Git. It is somehow easier and feels better that the online editor of my other website that runs Wordpress. Even adding pictures to posts seems easier this way than uploading to Wordpress and adding at the right places.

So now I am trying to decide whether I want to use this more as a personal blog - perhaps create a copy I can use for my personal blog or something else.

The fact of the matter is that I will probably release some more content on this blog and perhaps over time figure out what I want to do with it.

There is an itch to create and release content - so I have to scratch it.

You are always free to contact me. I prefer to be contacted by email, the other social media accounts are not checked as regularly. You can find the email in the footer and if you are human, then I have faith in you to figure out how to decode the actual email.
